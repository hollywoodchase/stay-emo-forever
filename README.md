Welcome to "Stay Emo Forever", a React.js app that allows patrons to sign up for a karaoke slot.

Well let me start at the beginning...

'Mo Without the E' is an emo karaoke cover band. People sign up to sing whicever emo classic they so desire, then the band calls them up and rocking and rolling occurs. 

This app allows venue patrons to put in their information, including which song they are requesting, and submit it to a database which is visible to the band, so that they can choose someone who has signed up.

The databse also accumulates email addresses so that the band can notify their fans when events will take place.

This app uses MongoDB and mongoose.
